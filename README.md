### Hi, I`m Kate! ðŸ‘‹
#### Junior frontend-developer from Saint-Petersburg.
I`m a motion/media designer by education, but over time, I realized that I prefer solving a problem than doing creative work and talking about tastes. I decided to try programming, and frontend was the closest to my interests. Today I spend all my free and busy time studying development and currently:

- I have successfully completed a course in frontend development by Rolling Scopes School (EPAM)
- learning React (have a course)
- starting to use TypeScript
- finding a company that will hire a really diligent and highly motivated young specialist.
